# Reflection 

## Controller components 

PID controller has following components that affect changes in steering angle: 

 - **Proportional** component steers car towards the planned path (center of the lane). The further away the car is from the center the bigger is the P-Component. But used alone it causes car to oversteer and go off the lane. 
 - **Integral** component eliminates possible systematic bias that is present in real cars. Fortunately simulator car doesn't have one. 
 - **Differential** component slows down proportianal component compensation if car is already getting close to the center. This prevents car from oversteering and approach center more smoothly. 
 
## Choosing the coefficients 

Kp, Ki, Kd coefficients for corresponding components were chosen manually through tries and errors. 

Ki component was left as zero since simulator doesn't have systematic bias. 

First, I tried different Kp components (leaving Ki and Kd zero). My goal was to find coefficient that would set steering angle big enough to pass turns. 

Then I added Kd coefficient to eliminate oversteering. The goal was to choose the value that would allow car to approach center more gradually. 

# Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5

  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)
  * Run either `./install-mac.sh` or `./install-ubuntu.sh`.
  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets 
    cd uWebSockets
    git checkout e94b6e1
    ```
    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).
